//     strict?:  true        only a workout STARTED at/after `since` counts; the dated name clause of
//                           the DONE RULE is off. Plan's "Start new pass" sets it: the new pass
//                           starts at that moment, and a session logged earlier the same day was
//                           the old pass's, whatever its name says.

//                           omits it and is never rewritten by the app.

//
// The app writes `S.queue` itself only for the in-app rotation feature (lib/rotation.ts, marked
// by `rotationId`); otherwise a planner does — any API client that PUTs state with a queue (a
// coaching agent, a script). null = the weekday model alone.
//
// PINS — a session can be given a day. The day sheet writes the per-date override that already
// exists (`S.dayPlan[iso] = <queue routine id>`); nothing new is stored. A pin re-dates the
// session: on its day it is the day's session (the weekday's own routines ride along, as on any
// queue day — effectiveRoutineIds in history.ts), on every other day from today on the floating
// rule skips it, and once it is done — on its day or early — the pin is fulfilled and reads as no
// override. A pin on a past date is stale: the session floats again. Pins change which session
// is NEXT, never what counts as DONE, so weekTally, the reminders' tally and whatever a planner
// reads back are untouched.
//
// DONE RULE — kept word for word with the api's reminder copy (api/queue.ts), and the rule a
// planner has to mirror, so nobody disagrees about which session is next: a session is done
// when any FINISHED workout on that routine exists after the week was applied. Missed sets are
// the planner's business. `S.active` is not in `S.workouts`, so a session in progress never
// counts. The name clause is for a "past workout" logged with an early clock: its start predates
// `since`, but it is dated inside the week (on or after `startsOn`) and its name — a merged
// session reads 'US W1 D1 + Core' — says which routines were done. The date bound matters: a
// planner may reuse its routine ids and names every week (W1 again after a restart), so a
// workout from a past week that happens to carry this week's name must never count.
